    "question": "What are Eyelash Extensions?",
    "answer": "Lash Extensions are synthetic strands that are made to replicate a natural eyelash. When applied, eyelash extensions lengthen and thicken your own natural eyelashes. Single strands are applied to each individual eyelash, one by one. With proper application, lash extensions look and feel completely natural."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long will a set of Eyelash Extensions Last?",
    "answer": "When properly applied, eyelash extensions will last the length of the natural growth cycle of your eyelashes. Everyone's experience will be different based on their day to day activities, but for most fills should only be necessary every 2 to 3 weeks."
  },
  {
    "question": "How often should you get fills?",
    "answer": "Most people will need a fill every 2 to 3 weeks to keep.  If you wait too long your eyelash extensions will fall out and you will require a full set. A fill eliminates any gaps between lashes that have fallen out due to the natural lash sheding cycle. Fill appointments require approximately 30-60 minutes."

  {
    "question": "Can you use mascara or eyelashcurlers? ",
    "answer": "One of the many benefits of eyelash extensions is that you do not need to use mascara or a curler. However, if you must apply mascara only use a water-based mascara. DO NOT USE OIL-BASED OR WATER-PROOF MASCARA as they can dissolve the bonding agent used and they can shorten the life of your eyelash extensions. Care also needs to be taken in washing off the mascara. Only use a water-based eye makeup remover. I do not recommend using an eyelash curler on your extensions as the curler can damage the extensions and possibly your own natural lashes."

  {
    "question": "Can you swim, shower, exercise, or visit a spa while wearing Eyelash Extensions?",
    "answer": "Yes. The bonding agent used to apply your eyelash extensions is waterproof and allows you to shower, swim, etc.  I still reommend you minimize the amount of water that comes in contact with your lashes for the first 12-24 hours."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you take care of my new Eyelash Extensions?",
    "answer": "Use ONLY water-based makeup and cleanser- oil breaks down the bonding adhesive. Use the brush I provide at the time of a full set application to comb them, which keeps them from twisting and tangling. DO NOT pick at them, and try to minimize the amount you touch your eyes. The oils from you hands will eventually break down the bonding adhesive. Try to sleep on your back to keep your lashes fuller longer."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long will it take to Apply Eyelash Extensions and how is it done?",
    "answer": "You will lay comfortably on a massage table while I apply an under eye gel pad over your lower lashes, which prevents them from getting caught in the upper lash line. Then the extensions are applied to each individual eyelash, which on average there are approximately 100 lashes on each eye"
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you choose the look you want?",
    "answer": "Eyelash extensions are available in a number of lengths and thickness. Your technician will consult with you to understand what type of style you are interested in."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should you prepare for your appointment?",
    "answer": "You should arrive with lashes clean and makeup free. Do not use oil-makeup remover to clean your lashes prior to the application. If you get your lashes tinted wait 48 hours before extension appointment."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there products that help extend the life of your extensions?",
    "answer": "There absolutely is! My preferred product is BabeLash, which slows the shedding process allowing your lashes to remain fuller longer.  "
