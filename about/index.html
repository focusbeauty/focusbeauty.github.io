<h3>Health, cosmetics, and skin care have always been more than an interest for me, but in the last year I have been given the opportunity to grow those interests into a career, which I am grateful for.</h3>
<h3>I grew up in the Seattle area, but moved away for some time, only to return home and settle back into my Seattle roots.</h3>
<h3>I look forward to seeing where this path takes me!</h3>
